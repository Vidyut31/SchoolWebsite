                <p class="text-muted text-left">Sunday school classes usually precede a Sunday church service and are used to provide catechesis to Christians, especially children and teenagers, and oftentimes adults as well. Churches of many Christian denominations have classrooms attached to the church used for this purpose. Many Sunday school classes operate on a set curriculum, with some teaching attendees a catechism. Members often receive certificates and awards for participation, as well as attendance.

                    Due to the fact that Sunday school classes precede morning worship on the Lord's Day, many provide a light breakfast, such as doughnuts and coffee, except on days in which Holy Communion is being celebrated due to the fact that many Christian denominations encourage fasting before receiving the Eucharistic elements.[1]

                    Sunday schools were first set up in the 18th century in England to provide education to working children.[2] William King started a Sunday school in 1751 in Dursley, Gloucestershire, and suggested that Robert Raikes start a similar one in Gloucester. Raikes was editor of the Gloucester Journal. He wrote an article in his journal, and as a result many clergymen supported schools, which aimed to teach the youngsters reading, writing, cyphering (doing arithmetic) and a knowledge of the Bible.[3]

                <p class="text-muted text-left">A school library is a store house of knowledge which satisfies our eternal desire for knowledge of the unknown and unseen. A school library is a place where the teachers and students can read, and from where they can borrow books. In our school, we also have a school library. It is housed in a separate two storied building. Indeed, the library is well constructed. There are many almirahs. The books are arranged on different shelves according to their subjects. There are separate reading room and an office room for the librarian. In our school library, we have a librarian who is a very nice person. There is a big reading room which is well furnished. So, we can read books there as we wish. When we take the help of the catalogue, the librarian at once finds the book, and thus he helps us a lot. We are given library cards by which we can issue books. The issued books can be kept for two weeks. Silence is must in the library. So, nobody can make any noise. Thus, anyone can study here with full attention without any disturbance. A school library is a part and parcel of a school. In other words, a school con never be complete without a library. Therefore, due to having such opportunity, I am proud of my school library.

                <p class="text-muted text-left">I read in a very big school. Likewise, it has a big hall. It is also known as the auditorium. It has a sound-proof system in it such that any voice or sound in it does not echo awfully.

                    It is situated in the main building in the centre of the school. It has five doors and a number of windows. It is air-conditioned but has electric fans also which are put to work if ever the AC system fails. They are also worked with a generator when there is an electric breakdown and the AC system does not work.

                    There is a vast dais at the end of the hall. The dais is quite high and there are stairs to climb it has a curtain for dramatic performances. There is also a lecture stand there for the speakers. A mike is there which is put to use when necessary.The front door is the widest. The four other doors two in the either wall are ‘comparatively less wide. Besides, there are two small doors behind the dais which open into small green houses.

                    At the time of any function, sofas and chairs are installed on the stage, that is, dais. Chairs and benches are then also installed in the entire hall for students. Only participants, senior teachers and VIPs sit on the sofas and chairs on the dais.

                <p>“All work and no play make Jack a dull boy”. Games and sports are an integral part of education. They assist in the overall development of a child. A healthy mind resides in a healthy body, sports and games keep a student physically healthy and fit. Moreover, merely bookish knowledge will produce only bookworms. Hence, sports have become an essential part of the curriculum of schools everywhere.

                    Our school too stresses upon this aspect of education and provides coaching to various sports to help students develop interest towards sports. We have games like Crickets, Hockey, Basket Ball, Volley Ball, Table Tennis, Athletics and Gymnastics –a wide variety from which the students can choose according to their interests.

                    All the students love to sit in the canteen and discuss the events of the day. The noise level is always very high in the canteen as everyone is shouting to make himself heard.

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance.

                    Manually taking attendance and registering it in files and musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.

                    To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work. An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.

                    Student attendance software is designed to record and manage daily student attendance in schools to speed up the daily attendance process and reduce manual work. It is used to track student's attendence, absentee record, attendance history and other related documents.</p>
